# openshift-OC

I have created this repo in order to make life a bit easier when running Openshift All In One (oc cluster)

In order to run this script, simply clone this repo, go to the openshift-OC directory and run the script **start-oc.sh**

In the future, I plan to add to add to this script and maybe add some other scripts to make life a bit easier.
